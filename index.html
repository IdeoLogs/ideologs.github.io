    <h2>What is Essence Sort?</h2>
        <p>Essence Sort is a test designed for the world of Naalsem, to see what essence type you might embody. Don't take it too seriously, it's more like a game. <br><br>
        This test uses the <a href="https://sapplyvalues.github.io/">SapplyValues UI</a>
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
  <h2>What do my results mean?</h2>
        <p>In the world of Naalsem, there are four essential types which everything is made of. Red is the body, blue is the mind, yellow is the soul, and purple is the will. Each person has all four essence types, but depending on your individual traits you have an "essentially affinity," which is the type you embody most. You can find a longer explanation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdkhspd69ic&ab_channel=CourtTutor">here</a>, but a brief explanation of each type is below.
        <br>
        Red essence is what makes up matter, the material world. Your flesh, organs, and bones are made from red essence. Those with an affinity for red essence are very physically oriented, and hot-blooded. They often desire a code or leader to guide them, and tend to be very loyal. When trained, these individuals can hone their bodies to an incredibly degree and even impart their strength into objects or people. 
        <br>
        Purple essence is force, and will. When you move your body or desire something, that's your purple essence. Those with an affinity for purple essence are strong-willed and charismatic, with a tendancy towards leadership. People with this affinity can develop control over natural forces like fire, wind, or lightning or directly impart their will on the people and world around them. 
        <br>
        Blue essence is information. Your mind, memories, and DNA are all written with blue essence. Those with an affinity for blue essence are intellectual and introspective, spending most of their time in their own head. Blue affinities can divine things unknown to others, or even alter the fabric of time and space. 
        <br>
        Yellow essence is the connection between things. The delicate homeostasis which keeps your body alive as well as your senses are regulated by yellow essence. Those with an affinity for yellow essence are perceptive and in-tune with the world around them. They can connect with divine beings for guidance, restore health to those who need it, or bring balance to turbulent souls.
